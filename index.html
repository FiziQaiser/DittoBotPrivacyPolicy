    <h1>Ditto Bot - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>By using the Ditto Discord bot, you accept its privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>1. What does Ditto store?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Nothing permanently.</strong> Ditto does not store server data, messages, or user information on any external database.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data (such as server structure, roles, and recent messages) is processed <strong>in-memory only</strong> during the execution of a cloning command. Once the operation is complete, the data is discarded immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Who can access the data?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No one, including developers, has access to your server's data or messages.</strong> All processing is done live in Discord without logging or external storage.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No data is stored that could be accessed later by developers or third parties.</li>
        <li>Ditto only performs actions you explicitly request via commands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How can I ensure my server data is removed?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Since Ditto does not store any data persistently, there’s nothing to delete.</li>
        <li>If you wish to revoke all access, simply <strong>kick the bot from your server</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Why does Ditto process server data temporarily?</h2>
    <p>
        Ditto temporarily accesses server structure and recent messages <strong>only</strong> to perform the cloning operation requested via the <code>/copy_this_server</code> command.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server data is required to recreate roles, categories, channels, and permissions accurately.</li>
        <li>Recent messages are optionally copied (if permissions allow) to help replicate the communication context.</li>
        <li>All of this is done in real-time and discarded immediately after execution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. How do I request complete removal or ask for privacy help?</h2>
    <p>
        Since Ditto does not store any data, no deletion request is necessary. However, you are always welcome to <a href="https://discord.gg/kTavknSvrZR" target="_blank">join our support server</a> if you have concerns or questions.
